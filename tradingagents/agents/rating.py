"""Shared 5-tier rating vocabulary and a deterministic heuristic parser.

The same five-tier scale (Buy, Overweight, Hold, Underweight, Sell) is used by:
- The Research Manager (investment plan recommendation)
- The Portfolio Manager (final position decision; its free-text fallback is read here)
- The memory log (rating tag stored alongside each decision entry)

Centralising it here avoids drift between those call sites.

``extract_rating`` returns ``None`` when no rating can be found, and every
caller turns that into ``REVIEW`` rather than a tradeable position: a decision
nobody can read is not a Hold, and a Hold recorded in its place is quoted back to
the next run as a call that was never made (#1170).
